With the use of regression techniques, this project will predict the sales price of
buildings in New York City. It will look at a number of different factors, including the
effects of COVID-19 on the market, and how the building's dimensions and location
influence the sales price. By doing so, we will gain a greater understanding of what areas
of the New York City real estate market will be most impacted in the event of a
pandemic.
